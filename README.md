### Additional queries - We can find out how many people are retiring from each and every department so that manager will have an idea about futrue resource management.
We can find out how many poeple are getting retired in next few years. So that,we use help of those soon to be retired people in mentorship or training program if we are lacking number of people in mentorship programs.
